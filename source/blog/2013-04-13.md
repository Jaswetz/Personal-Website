**Did you by accidentally add a file that you didn't wan't to git?**

...maybe a `.DS_Store`

Keep your repo clean by using `git rm` 

NOTE
: `git-rm` - Remove files from the working tree and from the index

First you wan't to add the file/folder to the .gitignore so that it doesn't happen again. Keep a hist or a snippet with your updated .gitignore somewhere so you have a good starting place for new projects. 

In .gitignore: 

    # A good set of Git ignores for mac users
    
    # OS generated files #
    ######################
    .DS_Store
    .DS_Store?
    ._*
    .Spotlight-V100
    .Trashes
    Icon?
    ehthumbs.db
    Thumbs.db

Now do a dry run with `-n` or `--dry-run`. This will show you what will be removed without removing it. 

`$` `git rm -n -r *.DS_Store`

# remove all .DS_Store files in your git index

Looks good? 

Okay, do it for real.

`$` `git rm -r *.DS_Store` 

Now record the changes to the repository with a commit

`$` `git commit -am "Removed .DS_Store files."`

Bye-bye to the pesky .DS_Store files.
